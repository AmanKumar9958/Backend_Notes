In this lecture we will learn about CRUD operations with MongoDB.

ORM: Object Relational Mapping
ODM: Object Document Mapping

MongoDB is a asynchronous code, means synchronous code will execute before asynchronous code
ex:
    userModel.create({
        name: "Aman Kumar",
        age: 20,
        email: "amancollege04@gmail.com"
    })

    console.log("Aman");

    console code will execute first then userModel.create() code will execute

To fix this we will async and await
