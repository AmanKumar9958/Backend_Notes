Middleware is something which serves in the between before going to any route.
Ex-
    If we want some data from facebook (user's DP), so before going to that route it we want to print something like (hello)
    then for doing this we will add Middleware

Creating Middleware:
    1. Middleware must be added before the routes (/, /about, etc)
    2. To use Middleware we ave to use app.use() and in this we have a function which accepts 3 parameters: req, res and next

Error Handling:
    1. For handling errors we create a middleware in last of all the routes and it accepts 4 parameters: err, req, res and next
