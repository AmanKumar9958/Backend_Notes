In this lecture we will learn about form handling, sessions and cookies

Session:
    A session is data stored on the server-side.
    It is used to remember the user while they navigate through different pages of a website.
    A unique Session ID is stored in the browser as a cookie, which connects the user to the session data on the server.

Cookie:
    A cookie is small data stored on the user's browser (client-side).
    It is created by the server and saved in the user's browser to remember things like login info or preferences.

Whenever we visit on any website (Instagram) and we ask something like show me this image, then that website aks who are you? Then we have to do login
on that particular website then it gives us the image or whatever we asked from it. But after doing login server forget we are you. And when we do any
another request to the server then it again ask for doing login which creates frustration.

For solving this issue we have something called cookies, cookies is like a unique string, which get stored in the frontend (browser) and also in our backend
and whenever we request something on the backend then our unique string (Cookie) also get attached with that request and we don't need to do login process
again and again.

And the connection/process between frontend to backend to stay connected is called Session.

In short:
    Cookies are like ID cards you carry with you.
    Sessions are like files stored in the office (server) that get opened when you show your ID.


Whenever we send data from frontend to backend then it doesn't go directly in plain text and it becomes unreadable and then we have to make readable again.
To make our data readable use have to use this:
    app.use(express.json())
    app.use(express.urlencoded({extended: true}));
